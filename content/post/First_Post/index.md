# JAVA
Java is one of the main general-purpose programming languages out there, first appeared in 1995 when it was developed by Sun Microsystems. Since then, Java has changed ownership and has gone through various changes to keep up with demand and modern computational challenges. 

### Why Java

Java is very popular, the more popular the language is the easier it becomes to solve problems using it and improve the language while in the process. 
Java is a platform independent language; this means that we can run a java program on any operating system as long as it has a Java virtual machine also known as JVM. 
It's also an object-oriented programming language which makes it easy to use especially when programming durable software. 
The JVM comes with a feature known as garbage collection, this is useful when it comes to memory efficiency.

### Road Map for a Java application.

All java programs follow a similar path regardless of the platform, a typical Java program written by a developer (Java code) is compiled by a Javac, the compiled file is turned into a bytecode which is known as the jar file and has .class extension. The jar file can be run on any operating system with JVM.

### How to Get Java on your Operating System

In order to get Java programs to run on your system, you need to have a Java Development Kit also known as a JDK. We have two main JDKs out there, the widely used one is supplied by the Oracle Co. and the RedHat OpenSource JDK. 

Once you get the JDK of your choice installed on your system, you will be to run programs on your device. We have three main components now, the JRE, Javac, JVM. Java Run Time environment to run the program, Java compiler to compile the program and the compiled program will be run on Java Virtual Machine.  For developers, you might want to download an Integrated Development Environment also known as the IDE. IDEs make it easier for a developer to code programs because we can import all the necessary libraries and classes. 

### Differences and Similarities between Java and other high profile general purpose languages.

Both C++ and Java are object-oriented programming languages.
Unlike other languages, Java has a feature called garbage collection which helps with using the memory efficiently.
