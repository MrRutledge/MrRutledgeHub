# How to find interesting datasets to work on when practising data science.

So one might ask, is it really that hard to find interesting datasets to work on? The answer to this question really depends on who is asking and why. Yes it is true we live in a period where there is more data than ever, open sourcing of data is gaining ground day by day, data generating tools are readily available. All these three facts fall in one or two ways one might use to get themselves quality data to work with.

## Available data sources

### Open Source datasets

Open source datasets are your best bet, they are used by everyone from seasoned professionals to absolute novices. A lot of datasets are being made open source, big companies put up big prizes for people who help them find better solutions. Getting involved in these competitions is actually a great way to show off your skills and get noticed by a potential employer especially if you're a beginner. Best places to find open source datasets include sites like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/data), [Dataset Search](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch), [Driven data](https://www.drivendata.org/), [awsome-lists](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets), [wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Tools/For_programmers), Govenment sites to mention but a few. Most of the data you will find on these sites will be up to date and free to access.

### Commercial / Priavte datasets.

Commercial datasets are exactly what you think they're; data vendors, we're seeing a steady increase of data vendors world wide. This growth has been boosted by a combination of decreasing cost of cloud storage and the increasing demand for all sorts of data. Unlike some open source providers, commercial datasets come with a degree of authenticity that might be missing in other datasets. Private dataset vendors like [Sports data](https://www.sportsdata.ag/), [Statistica](https://www.statista.com/), [Google](https://cloud.google.com/commercial-datasets/), agencies and academic centres make it their mission to provide quality data to their customers in order to retain the customers. One negative for commercial data is that it's often expensive to get access to some datasets and, the purchased data some times comes with a strict license. 

### Generating one's own data.

The third option to get yourself a dataset to practice on, is by generating your own data. This approach might sound very intimidating for non-programmers but, it shouldn't, infact it gives you a lot of wiggle room if you want be creative. Since it's your own data you can make decisions about what you want the data to include and etc. This approach can be very educational for a data scientist because there is a lot of different tools for a person who wishes to collect their own data. Some of the most come ways include [scrapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_scraping), [crawling the web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler) and pulling data from various dataset sources to make your own dataset. It can be expensive time-wise especially if you choose not to use any of the available tools from vendors. An example of a self-generated dataset is to [scrape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_scraping) or [crawl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler) a website to obtain data.

I must note that at the enterprise level, most companies use a combination of all these approaches in one way or the other. Indeed for anyone looking to work on big projects, one must familiarize themselves with all the above approaches because for projects running at big scale, the risk of using one approach is too high to be attempted.

In conclusion, before you embark on any data science projects make sure you have a clear goal and how you want to measure your success. This will help you narrow your search and keep you focused.
The best way I have found to help you define your project's goal is to start with what interests you the most and the pick a topic from that subset topics.
